Zero-shot image classification project

This project uses a zero-shot object detection model from hugging face to classify different objects in an image.
After running the file, an image should be shown with red boxes around the detected objects with the object label and model's confidence value.
The image being processed can be changed by changing the url variable to the url of another image The text labels variable should also be changed to whatever object is being detected and classified.
