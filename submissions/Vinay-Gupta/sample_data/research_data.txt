Survey Responses:
"I use social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram regularly. 
My profile is public and I share personal information including my 
location at Georgia Tech. I'm not very concerned about privacy 
because I trust these companies.

I've had my data compromised before when my email emily.davis@gatech.edu 
was included in a data breach. I received a notification from the 
university about this incident.

I would be interested in learning more about privacy protection tools."
