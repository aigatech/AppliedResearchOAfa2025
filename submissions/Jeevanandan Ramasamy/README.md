# üåê Lost in Translation Game
By Jeevanandan Ramasamy

## What it does
This project is a **fun AI translation game** built with Hugging Face + Gradio.  
You type a sentence, and the model translates it through multiple languages, showing each step, then back to English.  
The result is a hilarious, sometimes nonsensical, ‚Äúlost in translation‚Äù version of your original text.

Example Input: Hello World!
en ‚Üí ne: ‡§π‡•á‡§≤‡•ã ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ !
ne ‚Üí tr: Ho≈ügeldin d√ºnya!
tr ‚Üí zu: Sishayele emhlabeni!
zu ‚Üí mg: Miaraka amin'izao tontolo izao!
mg ‚Üí gl: Xunto ao mundo!
gl ‚Üí en: Together with the world!
