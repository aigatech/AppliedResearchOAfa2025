# Simple Mood Classifier and Music Playlist Suggester

Utilized existing HF models trained on mood classification to identify mood given a console input.
Then, I mapped the mood output to suggested playlist themes.
With the suggested playlist theme, I created an image with a prompt to a diffuser model to generate a cool album cover!

To run it, simply run the main.py python script and answer the initial console input!

An area of expansion would definitely be adding song recommendations in addition to playlist themes and mood.
I hope you liked my project.
