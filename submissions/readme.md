# LeetCode Multi-Approach Analyzer

A simple, focused tool that takes a LeetCode problem URL and provides multiple algorithmic approaches ranked by efficiency.

##Features

- **LeetCode Integration**: Paste any LeetCode problem URL
- **Multiple Approaches**: Get 3-4 different algorithmic solutions
- **Smart Ranking**: Approaches automatically ranked by efficiency (1 = best)
- **Complexity Analysis**: Time and space complexity for each approach
- **Pros/Cons**: Benefits and drawbacks of each method
- **AI-Powered**: Uses lightweight local models for intelligent analysis

##  Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
```bash
python appy_fixed.py
```

### How to Use
1. **Paste URL**: Copy a LeetCode problem URL (e.g., `https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/`)
2. **Click Analyze**: Press "Analyze Approaches"
3. **Get Results**: View ranked approaches with complexity analysis

## What You Get

### Problem Information
- **Title**: Problem name
- **Difficulty**: Easy/Medium/Hard
- **Description**: Clean problem text
- **ID**: LeetCode problem number

### Ranked Approaches
Each approach includes:
- **Name**: Algorithmic technique (e.g., "Two Pointers", "Hash Table")
- **Description**: How the approach works
- **Time Complexity**: Big-O notation (e.g., O(n), O(nÂ²))
- **Space Complexity**: Memory usage
- **Ranking**: Efficiency score (1 = best, 4 = least efficient)
- **Pros**: Benefits of this approach
- **Cons**: Drawbacks and limitations

## Technical Details

- **Model**: Uses lightweight `codet5p-220m` (220M parameters)
- **Fallback**: Smart fallback approaches if AI analysis fails
- **Fast**: Quick analysis with minimal resource usage
- **Reliable**: Works even when models struggle with complex outputs
