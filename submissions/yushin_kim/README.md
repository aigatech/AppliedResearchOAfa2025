# ðŸ§© Word Clue

**Word Clue** is a lightweight, text-based mystery game inspired by the classic *Clue* board game.
Your goal is to sequentially uncover **who the culprit is, where the crime took place, and what weapon was used** inside a mysterious mansion.

You progress by choosing words as clues. Each word you provide is compared against hidden attributes of the true culprit, place, and weapon. The system gives you feedback about how close your clue is, guiding your deduction step by step.

## ðŸ’¡ What it does

* At the start of each game, the system secretly selects a **culprit, place, and weapon**.
* In each phase (Culprit -> Place -> Weapon), you receive a list of candidate words.
* You choose one word per turn to test as a clue.
* The game computes semantic similarity between your chosen word and each candidate.
    * Technically, each candidate is treated as the centroid of its hidden attributes.
* Feedback is given in the form of **relative ranking** (e.g., "Rank 2 / 6") and the closest candidate.
* After **three** rounds of questioning, you must make your final guess.
* Your objective is to solve all three phases by making the correct guesses.
