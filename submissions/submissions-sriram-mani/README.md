# AI@GT Applied Research Fall 2025
Thank you for your interest in joining AI@GT's Applied Research Team! This is an open ended assessment designed for you to demonstarte your creativity and coding ability. You will all be using [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) to create a project of your choice! To ensure this assessment stays accessible, we ask all candidates to spend no more than 1.5 hours on their idea. Submissions will remain open until Wednesday Septermber 3 @11:59pm and will be reviewed on a rolling basis  

---

##  Instructions
1. Fork this repository.  
2. Install any HuggingFace libraries you need for your project, for example:

   ```bash
   pip install transformers datasets
   
3. Build your project in submissions/<your_full_name>/

## Submission
When finished, open a Pull Request (PR) to this repo. Title your PR: "Submission: Your Name". Please include a short README.md inside your submission folder with:
- Project title
- What it does
- How to run it

#### ⚠️ Important
- **Do not commit model weights, large datasets, or your virtual environment (`venv/`, `.env/`, etc.)**.  
- Only include the code, small config files, and instructions to re-install dependencies

#### Note: You don’t need a GPU to complete this! Plenty of HuggingFace models (DistilBERT, MiniLM, etc.) run well on CPU. Focus on building something small but creative! We look foward to seeing all of your ideas come to life. If you have any questions, please reach out to zishani3@gatech.edu.
