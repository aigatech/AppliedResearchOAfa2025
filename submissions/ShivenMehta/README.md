
Project Title: Pokémon Identificator and Counter Guide

What my program does: My program takes an image of a pokémon, perhaps one a user cannot identify and returns an image and the name of the best counter for the inputed pokémon. 
This program can be handy when battling in pokémon games like pokémon go.

How to run the program: 
1. Insert an image of your unknown pokemon into the folder /submissions/ShivenMehta 2.
2. Enter the file name of the image in the blank on line 20 in /submissions/ShivenMehta/pokemon.py: "img = Image.open('_____').convert("RGB")"         
Ex: "img = Image.open('squirtle.jpg').convert("RGB")"
3. Your counters will be returned and an image of the best counter will be displayed
