Generative AI Engineer Job Description Template
Job Title: Generative AI Engineer
Location: Remote / Hybrid / [City, State]
Job Type: Full-time
Department: AI Research / Machine Learning / Engineering

About the Role
We are seeking a Generative AI Engineer to design, develop, and deploy state-of-the-art generative models across text, image, code, or audio domains. You’ll work with large language models (LLMs), diffusion models, or transformers to create intelligent applications and systems that push the boundaries of creativity, automation, and human-computer interaction.

This role is ideal for engineers passionate about applying deep learning and generative modeling to build tools, products, and workflows with real-world impact.

Key Responsibilities
Design, fine-tune, and deploy generative models using architectures such as GPT, Stable Diffusion, or custom transformers
Implement and optimize inference pipelines for real-time or batch generation (text, image, code, audio)
Collaborate with researchers, product teams, and designers to integrate generative AI into products or user-facing tools
Build data pipelines for model training, evaluation, and continual learning
Monitor model performance, address bias or hallucination issues, and improve output reliability
Stay current with research in generative AI and contribute to model selection, benchmarking, and experimentation
Qualifications
Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, or a related field
Strong understanding of deep learning and transformer architectures
Proficiency in Python and ML libraries like PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers
Experience working with LLMs, diffusion models, or generative adversarial networks (GANs)
Familiarity with prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and evaluation methods for generative outputs
Knowledge of model deployment (e.g., ONNX, TorchServe, Triton) and performance optimization techniques
Preferred Qualifications
Experience building generative tools for content creation, chatbots, code generation, or digital art
Familiarity with vector databases, embeddings, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
Contributions to open-source ML projects or published research
Awareness of ethical considerations, including output filtering, consented data use, and generative misuse risks
What We Offer
Access to cutting-edge models and GPU infrastructure
Opportunity to work on production-grade generative AI systems
Collaborative environment with researchers, engineers, and product innovators
Competitive compensation, flexible schedules, and growth opportunities
Support for research, open-source contributions, and conference attendance
How to Apply
Submit your resume and any relevant projects, GitHub repositories, or generative model demos you’ve built or contributed to.
