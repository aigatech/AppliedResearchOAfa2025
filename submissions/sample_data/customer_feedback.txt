Feedback:
"I had an excellent experience with your service! The representative, 
Alex Thompson, was very helpful. I live in Miami, FL and the delivery 
was fast. My credit card ending in 4532 was charged correctly.

However, I had an issue with the product quality. The item arrived 
damaged. I called your support line at (800) 555-1234 and spoke with 
Maria Rodriguez who resolved the issue quickly.

I would definitely recommend your company to friends and family.
My address is 567 Ocean Drive, Miami, FL 33139 if you need to send 
a replacement."
