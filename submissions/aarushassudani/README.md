Project Title: SynaSight

Run by running main.py. A default texture is shown, in the window with the texture press i to input your own texture. You can then type in the console a custom texture and it will show up in the texture window.

My initial idea for this was to generate a feedback map overlaid on a silhouette of a foot to visually represent the pressure sense we get on our feet when we walk on certain types of land. However this wouldnâ€™t really nicely visualize the texture to someone looking at a 2d screen so I pivoted to creating a 3d model of the texture. 

What the app does is generates a texture map based on text input from the user.
