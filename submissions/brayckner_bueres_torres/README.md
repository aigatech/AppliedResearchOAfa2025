## What it does
Detects malicious network traffic patterns using XGBoost, identifying potential DDoS attacks, port scans, and other network anomalies in real-time traffic data.

## Why it's useful
- Helps SOC teams identify threats faster
- Demonstrates when traditional ML (XGBoost) outperforms deep learning for tabular data
- Shows proper handling of imbalanced cybersecurity datasets
