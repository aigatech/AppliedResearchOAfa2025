# TV Show Tinder
This is a console based TV show recommender that uses Hugging Face sentence embeddings and the TVmaze API to suggest shows based on your preferences.

The recommender encodes TV show descriptions into vectors using a Hugging Face sentence transformer and creates a user profile by averaging the embeddings of liked shows. Recommendations are generated by computing cosine similarity between the user profile and all unrated show embeddings, returning the top matches.
