Hi!

I'm Jai, and I am the GNC/Avionics lead for GTSC. On behalf of the GTSC team, I would like to congratulate you and welcome you to our team! As you are aware, GTSC aspires to take on and accomplish supersonic records with RC aircraft and we have a lot of really cool projects and programs to help contribute to this! On the GNC side of things, we have a ton of ongoing work supporting the development of a flight control system, a ground based command and control center, and the avionics systems.

To get started, we have our shop nights from 6:30 to 9:30pm on Mondays and Wednesdays in Weber CoDE/CoVE (2nd floor) in addition to optional shop nights on Saturdays from 12-4pm also in Weber CoDE/CoVE. We have our first General Body Meeting tomorrow (Sep 3rd) at 6:30pm in Weber CoDE followed by shop night and I'd love to see you there! This will be an opportunity for you to learn more about the projects we are working, be introduced to other members of the sub-team, and get you started working on. Please reply to this email to let me know if you are able to attend the meeting. If you have any other questions, feel free to let me know! I really look forward to meeting and working with you!
