# Project Title: Simple Task Planner Agent

### What it does
This project uses the `google/flan-t5-base` model from Hugging Face to act as a simple planning agent. It takes a high-level goal as input and breaks it down into a numbered list of actionable steps, demonstrating a core reasoning capability needed for more complex AI agents.

### How to run it
1. Ensure all dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file are installed.
2. Open and run all cells in the `simple_task_planner.ipynb` notebook using a Jupyter environment.
