# Mood Checker ðŸŽ­

## What it does
A simple AI-powered tool that analyzes your text and tells you if you're feeling happy, sad, or neutral! It uses a pre-trained HuggingFace model to understand the emotional tone of your messages.

## How to run it
1. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install transformers torch
   ```

2. Run the mood checker:
   ```bash
   python mood_checker.py
   ```

3. Type in any message when prompted, and it will tell you the mood!

## Example
- Input: "I'm so excited about today!"
- Output: "ðŸ˜Š This message sounds HAPPY!"

- Input: "I'm feeling down today"
- Output: "ðŸ˜” This message sounds SAD!"

## Why this project?
This project demonstrates how easy it is to use AI models for real-world applications. In just a few lines of code, we can analyze emotions in text - something that could be useful for mental health apps, customer service, or social media analysis!
