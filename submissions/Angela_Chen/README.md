Project Title: Movie and TV Show Review Analyzer

My project is a emotion detector based on the reviews of movie and tv shows the user gives. Using the HuggingFace emotion classification model, it will detect the main emotion of the review, with the emojis. It also allows you to write multiple reviews at the same time and view the past reviews you inputted.

To run it, simply download the code, ensuring that python 3 is installed with the required huggingface libraries. Then, simply run the code in your terminal. A menu of options will pop up and the rest is self explanatory!
