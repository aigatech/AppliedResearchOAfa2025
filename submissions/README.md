Hi!

I'm so sorry for the mess that you are about to see. I call it BoneBroth.

Theoretically, this is a YOLOv11 model that should be able to tell the difference between different types of bone fractures with...middling accuracy.

Just go ahead and run everything from the top, you may have to include your kaggle token/login? I am unsure at the moment.
