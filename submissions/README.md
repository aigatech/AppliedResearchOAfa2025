This project contains code for sentiment analysis and data visualization using Python.

The goal of this project is to take a collection of reviews for a course (such as from RMP) and run sentiment analysis on each to determine whether the reviews are more positive or negative on aggregate. We can also compare the positive/negative ratio to the RMP score to easily check accuracy.
