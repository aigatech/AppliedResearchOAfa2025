# Mood-to-Music Recommender:

About: This web app (powered by Gradio) analyzes your mood based on natural language input (from Hugging Face Transformers â€“ BART model) and recommends the perfect playlist.

Some possible input examples:

> "Can't sleep, mind racing with thoughts"

> "Perfect Sunday morning with coffee"
