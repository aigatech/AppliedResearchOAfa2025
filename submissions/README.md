# Portfolio Risk Coach Agent

An AI-powered portfolio risk analysis system that combines gradient learning, HuggingFace NLP models, and conversational AI to provide intelligent portfolio risk assessment and learning capabilities.

## üéØ What This Project Does

This agent analyzes investment portfolios using multiple AI approaches:
- **Neural Network Risk Assessment**: PyTorch-based gradient learning that adapts to user feedback
- **NLP Analysis**: HuggingFace models for sentiment analysis and text generation
- **Conversational Interface**: LangChain agent with natural language understanding

The system learns from user corrections, improving its risk predictions over time through real gradient updates.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set up API Key (Optional)
Create a `.env` file for Gemini integration:
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
```

### 3. Run the Agent
```bash
python main.py
```

## üí° Key Features

### **Portfolio Analysis**
- Risk level assessment (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- Sector exposure calculations
- Concentration and volatility metrics
- Comprehensive risk insights

### **AI Learning**
- Gradient-based learning from user feedback
- Neural network weight updates
- Learning history tracking

- Natural language understanding

## üéØ Example Commands

```bash
# Analyze portfolios
"Analyze tech_heavy portfolio"
"Compare tech_heavy and diversified portfolios"

# Learn from feedback
"Learn from feedback: tech_heavy, too risky, LOW"

# Add custom portfolios
"Add custom portfolio: my_portfolio, AAPL:0.4,MSFT:0.3,TSLA:0.3"

# Educational questions
"What is portfolio risk?"
"Explain diversification"
```

## üìä Built-in Portfolios

- **Tech Heavy**: AAPL (40%), MSFT (30%), TSLA (30%)
- **Diversified**: AAPL, JPM, XOM, JNJ, V (20% each)
- **Energy Focused**: XOM (40%), CVX (30%), COP (30%)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **PyTorch**: Neural networks and gradient learning
- **HuggingFace**: Sentiment analysis and text generation
- **LangChain**: Conversational agent framework
- **Gemini**: LLM for reasoning (optional)

## üìù Sample Output

```
RISK ANALYSIS: tech_heavy
Risk Level: HIGH (65.2%)
Gradient Score: 62.1%
Sentiment Score: 68.3%

COMPOSITION: 3 stocks, 100.0% total weight
SECTOR EXPOSURE: Technology: 100.0%

RISK METRICS:
