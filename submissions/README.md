Project Title: Custom Mood Playlist Finder
--> What it does: The client describes their mood/day in a short statement (<3 sentences), and the playlist finder will analyze their mood and recommend them a playlist to match.
--> How to run: Run the customplaylist.py file and the terminal will prompt an imput. Type "streamlit run customplaylist.py" and Streamlit should open up on your browser. From there, just enter your mood statement.
